- Update idir path (line#9 in merge_all.py, line#12 exp_timeline.py and line #12 in cmd_analysis.py) with the path to "datasets" folder
i.e. update the below line in merge_all.py file
idir="/Users/amee/Desktop/Research/CPS/dataset/experiments/datasets/" with the output of pwd command when in shell terminal of the above step 2.

Step 4:
