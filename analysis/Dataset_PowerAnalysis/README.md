To plot the graphs from the dataset, follow these steps:

-  Enter the folder Scripts
-  Run Scripts/Plotting.py

This script needs three input files including the followings:

- ITERATION-PLOTS.csv
- VELOCITY-PLOT.csv
- WEIGHT-PLOT.csv

Alternatively, plotting steps has been shown in Plotting-in-JupyterNotebook.pdf file, and running the code in Jupyter notebook should be enough to plot the graphs.
