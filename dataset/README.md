# Repository Description

## RAD_Power_Monitoring
* [`csv`](../dataset/RAD_Power_Monitoring) stores RAD Power Monitoring data in csv file format for all days on which the known and unknown procedures were run. 

## RAD_Commands

* [`csv`](../dataset/RAD_Commands/csv.zip) stores RAD in csv file format and is further divided in two folders of known_procedures and unknown_procedures.
* [`MongoDB`](../dataset//RAD_Commands/mongodb.zip) stores RAD in a MongoDB instance.


The known_procedures are further divided in two folders: `anomaly` and `benign`. There are 
25 files that have known procedures (see [procedure details](../docs/Experiment_Steps.pdf) for more information) and are used for our command analysis. The following table shows the labels and the description assigned to each tracing file.
