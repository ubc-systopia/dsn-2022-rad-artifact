# cps-security-code
Prototyping for the CPS security project

## gRPC

Currently working with the following versions: Python 3.7.3, libprotoc (grpc_tools.protoc) 3.15.2

From my past experience, protocol buffers can be very sensitive to version changes!

Add the grpc folder to the PYTHONPATH environment variable
